# Django-Primer-Projects
My exploration of the django framework in python
1. Generates and displays a matrix based on user input
2. Perform numerous string operations on the string input given by the user and the subsequent selection
3. Takes input for number of random numbers to be generated and also number of columns, reads user input and displays a table depending on value selected in dropdown and another randomly generated number.
